## gp\_configuration\_history
包含错误检测和恢复操作时所做的系统变更。

The **gp\_configuration\_history** table contains information about system changes related to fault detection and recovery operations. The fts_probe process logs data to this table, as do certain related management utilities such as `gpcheck`, `gprecoverseg`, and `gpinitsystem`. For example, when you add a new segment and mirror segment to the system, records for these events are logged to gp\_configuration\_history.

## gp\_db\_interfaces
包含segmengs节点网络相关的一些信息。

The **gp\_db\_interfaces** table contains information about the relationship of segments to network interfaces. This information, joined with data from ***gp\_interfaces***, is used by the system to optimize the usage of available network interfaces for various purposes, including fault detection.
